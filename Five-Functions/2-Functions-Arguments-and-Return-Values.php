PHP Functions Ex. #2: Arguments and Return Values

This PHP exercise has two parts. For the first, you will create a function to accept two arguments, perform a calculation using them,
then return a sentence with the result to the browser. The function will calculate the area of a rectangle, with the two arguments
being width and height. (Reminder: area = width * height.) The sentence to be returned is "A rectangle of length $l and width $w
has an area of $area.", where $l and $w are the arguments and $area is the result.
