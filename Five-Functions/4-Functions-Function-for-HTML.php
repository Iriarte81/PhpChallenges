/* 
PHP Functions Ex. #4: Function for HTML

For this PHP exercise, first create an array called $months. Use the names of the months as keys, and the number of days for each month
as values. For February, use the following for your value: "28 days, if leap year 29".

Next, write a function to create an option element for a form's select field. Make sure each option will be upper case. 
Both the array and the function should precede the HTML for the page.

Once again, you will be requesting user input. Create a form for the user with the request,
"Please choose a month." Next, provide a select field with the months as options,
 looping through the array you created and using the function to create the option elements.

When the user clicks the submit button, return the statement "The month of $month has $number days.",
where $month is the name of the month the user chose, and $number is the number of days. Be sure to include
a different response for February.
