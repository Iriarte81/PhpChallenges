Php Challenges (Instructions)

Herein are some progressive php challenges and their custom (created by me) and original (created by the challenges' creators) solutions.
The challenges as published in the no longer maintined www.phpexercises.com website.

The challenges are inteneded to be solved sequentially - each exercises' title indicates it's order in the sequence from Challenge #1 to #31. The challenges vary in lenght and complexity and some require code from previous exercises.

The folders appear arranged alphabetically, but their original, recommended and intended order is as follows:

1. Beginnings (1-7)
2. Control Structures (8-11)
3. Forms (12-15)
4. Arrays (16-22)
5. Functions (23-28)
6. Classes (and Objects)  (29-31)
